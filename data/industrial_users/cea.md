The CEA is a major research organisation working in the best interests of the French State, its economy and citizens. Thanks to its strong roots in fundamental research, it is able to provide tangible solutions to meet their needs in four key fields:
* Low-carbon energy (nuclear and renewable)
* Digital technology
* Technology for medicine of the future
* Defence and national security

CEA has developed several software tools using OCaml:

- [Frama-C](https://www.frama-c.com/) dedicated to analysis of C code,
- [Binsec](https://binsec.github.io/) dedicated to analysis of binary code,
- [Caisar](https://www.caisar-platform.com/) dedicated to the trustworthiness of an AI-based software,
- [Colibri2](https://colibri.frama-c.com/) a constraint solver,
- [Why3find](https://git.frama-c.com/pub/why3find) an equivalent of ocamlfind for Why3 (with many more features related to program proof).
